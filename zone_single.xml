						<description><![CDATA[The Liberals are managing down Alberta's industry by imposing new regulations, killing pipeline options, withdrawing tax incentives, and passing energy-hostile bills]]></description>
													<content:encoded><![CDATA[There's long been a view in Alberta that the Trudeau government is intentionally winding down Alberta's oilsands, and ultimately the entire fossil fuel industry.

This belief has a basis in fact. Indeed, you could say it's not a fake fact, but an honest-to-goodness fact fact.

It was Prime Minister Justin Trudeau himself who said <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/we-need-to-phase-them-out-trudeau-draws-fire-over-oilsands-remark">in January 2017</a>: "We can't shut down the oilsands tomorrow. We need to phase them out. We need to manage the transition off of our dependence on fossil fuels.

"That is going to take time. And, in the meantime, we have to manage that transition."

He said that to a friendly audience in Peterborough, Ont. A few days later he was in Calgary, where criticism had erupted.

<a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/justin-trudeau-says-he-misspoke-with-talk-of-phasing-out-oilsands">Asked about his comments</a>, he said, "um, I misspoke . . . I said something the way I shouldn't have said it."

But Trudeau didn't say he'd been wrong. He just wished, it seemed, that he hadn't made himself so obvious.

The key word in Trudeau's Peterborough remarks was "manage." As in, "we have to manage that transition."

That's what the Liberals have been doing since being elected in 2015.

<span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">They're managing down Alberta's industry by imposing new regulations, killing pipeline options, withdrawing tax incentives and passing energy-hostile bills such as C-48 and C-69.</span>

Their goal isn't to shutter Alberta's main industry tomorrow. They see it as a multi-decade thing.

But managing an industry down is kind of like nudging a toboggan at the top of a steep hill.

Give it a little push and it might slide a short way. Or it might suddenly speed up, run loose and smash into a tree.

That is suddenly happening. A variety of factors encouraged by the Liberals have now run out of control, turning Alberta's managed slide into an abrupt and uncontrolled plunge.

The Liberals may get the moribund industry they envision — about a generation early.

The crash in prices for Alberta oil and bitumen is a direct result of Liberal hostility to both the Northern Gateway and the Energy East pipelines.

Those ideologically motivated moves left just one option for offshore export. Eventually, the Liberals had to put themselves in the strange position of buying the Trans Mountain pipeline project for $4.5 billion.

They promptly made such a mess of it that Federal Court judges overturned the National Energy Board approval.

Boxed in, increasingly reliant on overstressed rail, beset by unending hostility in B.C. and berated by U.S. competitors, the typical barrel of Alberta oil now sells <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/business/local-business/varcoe-alberta-cant-have-oil-racing-out-of-the-ground-at-10-a-barrel-says-premier">for a fraction of world prices</a>.

We're at the stage where some producers (not refiners) are willing to <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/business/energy/varcoe-growing-list-of-producers-call-on-notley-to-curb-oil-output-to-fix-dizzying-price-discounts">shut in their own barrels</a> in order to drive prices back up.

And that, of course, is exactly what the anti-oilsands people want; a product so valueless that it's simply left in the ground.

Investors might see this crisis as a cyclical thing, maybe even a good moment to invest before energy starts roaring again.

But hardly anybody expects a quick relaunch.

<span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">How could they, when virtually every industry and investment expert says Bill C-69 will make construction of future pipelines virtually impossible?</span>

How could they, when Trans Mountain is mired in the latest round of NEB hearings and will inevitably face more court challenges after construction restarts?

How could they, when <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/braid-a-federal-tanker-ban-that-doesnt-ban-tankers-just-alberta-oil">Bill C-48</a> isn't a North Coast tanker ban at all, but an export ban on Alberta's refined products? (Under C-48 the world's biggest tanker is free to land at Kitimat, B.C., as long as it doesn't load a long list of Alberta's primary and refined products.)

The whole plan — Liberal as well as Alberta NDP — has been to replace oil and gas with a variety of green and upgraded products.

After a leisurely generation or so, petroleum was to pass into gracious retirement.

But that assumed external economics would somehow stay neutral.

Instead, deeply negative trends are running away with Alberta's economy and main industry.

The price gap is forecast to cost the Alberta treasury $5 billion per year.

On Tuesday, respected academic <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/economist-says-no-quick-fix-for-albertas-economy-longer-term-solutions-needed-to-end-debt">Trevor Tombe</a> said the Alberta government's annual deficit could be $40 billion by 2040 (equivalent, broadly speaking, to $14 billion today).

Premier Rachel Notley's NDP is madly racing to goose upgrading with cash injections.

She <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/real-and-present-danger-notley-appoints-three-envoys-to-help-address-oil-price-differential/wcm/a2c7567c-4e12-4305-9a1c-b8cf94a5b4af">strikes a panel</a> to consult on the price gap and names as one member <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/corbella-notley-names-anti-oil-friend-to-new-energy-panel">Brian Topp</a>, her ex-chief of staff with a long record of hostility to oil and gas. What on earth is she thinking?

The damage to Ottawa's finances will be huge, but that seems slow to sink in.

Maybe that's because for many of Trudeau's MPs and ministers, the crisis looks like a kind of victory.

The plan for Alberta is working. Just a little early, that's all.

						<description><![CDATA[Despite new rules aimed at closing financial loopholes for third-party advertisers, Alberta saw a significant surge in political action committees over the past year, according to the annual report from Alberta's chief electoral officer.

The <a href="https://www.elections.ab.ca/wp-content/uploads/201718-Annual-Report-of-the-Chief-Electoral-Officer-of-Alberta.pdf">report</a>, released Monday, noted of the 21 third-party advertisers registered in Alberta as of March 31, some 13 came into being between 2017 and 2018. Since then, seven of those groups were deregistered, though another 10 sprouted up in their place.

Late last year, Alberta's NDP <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/whats-next-for-political-action-committees-as-govt-eyes-new-rules">tweaked election funding regulations</a> to limit the amount of cash third-party groups can spend in the months before an election, capping the amount at $150,000 after Dec. 1 going into an election year.

Albertans are expected to go to the polls in the spring.

David Taras, chair of media studies at Mount Royal University, said the landscape for political financing has significantly changed in recent years, though Canada has seen only a fraction of the massive influence exerted by political action committees south of the border.

"The tools have changed. You can't ignore the fact that social media can reach massive audiences almost instantly," he said.

"With very little money, these groups can have tremendous power in terms of agenda setting."

Last month, the NDP called for Alberta's election commissioner to <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/braid-kenneys-cause-scores-a-cash-bonanza-from-car-dealers">investigate ties between the UCP and Shaping Alberta's Future</a>, a PAC that was registered in June, but in only one quarter of reporting managed to raise some $375,000 in support of Jason Kenney's party.

Most of those funds were donated from Alberta car dealers, and controversy erupted after a letter surfaced from the Motor Dealers’ Association urging members to donate to the PAC, while suggesting Kenney had promised its board to cancel changes to labour legislation passed by the NDP and meet with industry officials lobbying to roll back recent changes to industry oversight, among other pledges.

Kenney's office denied any promises were made, while MDA president Denis Ducharme suggested there might have been some miscommunication over how the letter was worded, echoing the UCP leader's insistence that no promises had been made.

While the rise of third-party advertisers has initially aligned with right-leaning parties, several PACs from the opposite end of the political spectrum have also emerged, including a number driven by public-sector unions.

Kevin Lee, director of election finances for Elections Alberta, said despite new rules reigning in the spending activities of third-party advertisers, the agency <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/chief-electoral-officer-warns-of-dangers-of-third-party-activities-in-next-alberta-election">remains troubled</a> by the sizable loopholes that remain for well-heeled donors who are free to fork over money without limit outside of election cycles.

"The concern still exists not only in the numbers, but more in regard to the dollars that are being raised," he said.

"We still have recommendations outstanding in regard to these groups."

A review of financial statements released by PACs registered to raise money in Alberta found just more than $2 million was raised as of the third quarter of 2018 for political advertising from both sides of the political spectrum.

Lee noted those groups can continue to raise funds without limit during the election period from corporations or unions, even though their spending is curtailed until election day.

Elections Alberta also saw a significant rise in complaints to the chief electoral officer, prompting the hiring of a full-time investigator last year.

Lee said complaints, of which 51 were filed during the 2017-18 fiscal year, ranged from byelection beefs to party nomination squabbles and concerns levied over third-party advertisers. Of those, 11 resulted in an investigation while eight more remain under review — the remaining 32 were closed with no infractions found.

Despite the rise of PACs in Alberta mirroring the surge in the U.S., Taras noted Canadians are much different in terms of their political allegiance than their neighbours to the south.

"In Canada it's very different — most Canadians are movable. Canadian voters tend to be up for grabs. In the U.S. it's blood tribes," he said.

"Canadian voters are volatile but they don't really pay attention until the last 10 days before an election. Before that, everything is just background noise."

						<description><![CDATA[The heart of the matter: Canada needed more pipelines years ago and Ottawa didn't deliver.]]></description>
													<content:encoded><![CDATA[More locomotives. More upgrading. More tax writeoffs.

But more importantly, more pipelines.

Alberta faces an economic squeeze because of plunging oil prices — West Texas Intermediate crude dropped more than $3 to close at US$53.43 a barrel on Tuesday — while the wide price differential pounding Alberta oil is intensifying the pain.

Today, the provincial government is searching for solutions, both in the short and long term.

Plan A is to see more oil pipelines built, but Enbridge’s Line 3 replacement project won't be operating until later next year while Trans Mountain and Keystone XL are both stuck in stasis.

It's time to break the glass in case of oilpatch emergency.

<span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Premier Rachel Notley is discussing a series of steps to remedy the plight of Alberta heavy crude, which sold for less than US$18 a barrel on Tuesday. The light oil blend Edmonton par sold for less than half of U.S. benchmark prices, according to data from Net Energy. </span>

On Monday, the premier announced <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/real-and-present-danger-notley-appoints-three-envoys-to-help-address-oil-price-differential/wcm/a2c7567c-4e12-4305-9a1c-b8cf94a5b4af">a team of three envoys</a> will sit down with energy company executives to come up with options to tackle the crisis.

They will have to grapple with the divisive idea of government curtailing oil output as some producers call for the province to take such steps.

Notley made another move Tuesday, more than doubling the amount of incentives offered by the province — increasing them to $2.1 billion — to help Alberta upgrade and add more value to its oil and natural gas resources.

The province announced two initiatives on this front in the spring.

In one expanded program, the province will make $1.1 billion in royalty tax credits available to companies willing to build new petrochemical facilities in the province, up from the initial amount of $500 million.

It will mirror a similar 2016 program that spurred construction of a $3.5-billion <span class="doctext">propane dehydrogenation and polypropylene complex in Strathcona County. (</span>A decision on a similar petrochemical facility is expected later this year.)

Projects chosen to receive the next round of tax credits will be announced in the coming weeks.

A second program unveiled last spring, called the Petrochemical Feedstock Infrastructure Program, has been doubled, now offering $1 billion in available loan guarantees and grants to industry.

Earlier in the year, the government said the money would be used to "incentivize investment in new straddle plants to separate high-value natural gas liquids (NGLs) from Alberta natural gas."

<span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">There is no shortage of prospective players eyeing Alberta's cheap energy feedstocks or the government's new incentives. The province received 23 applications for both programs.</span>

"This will absolutely get us on the radar and will attract a lot more interest in Alberta and, I believe, we will certainly get more value-added projects being built in the province," said<span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> <span class="doctext">David Chappell, chair of the </span>Resource Diversification Council, w<span class="doctext">hich represents petrochemical and midstream companies.</span></span>

One can debate the philosophical merits of getting deeper into the subsidy game. But moving Alberta up the value chain remains a long-term strategy that will take years to nurture.

On the short-term front, the Notley government previously asked Ottawa to invest in new <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/business/energy/varcoe-canada-bought-an-oil-pipeline-how-about-adding-some-locomotives">locomotives</a> that could move more oil by rail out of the province, cutting a discount that is costing the country an estimated $80 million a day.

The premier has also requested the Trudeau government give oil transportation priority over other products — except grain — that move by rail.

<span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">The province noted Ottawa has taken similar action to unclog grain backlogs on the Prairies in the past.</span>

Canada's two main railway companies did not respond Tuesday when asked about the idea, but the proposal will face stiff opposition from other sectors that rely on trains — think coal or potash — if they are forced to wait on the sidelines.

"I don't think it makes much sense," said Robin Campbell, president of the Coal Association of Canada.

"What you're going to do is penalize all the other industries for the sake of oil, which means you will have layoffs in other industries if they can't get their product to market."

On another front, the province recently wrote a letter to federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau, encouraging Ottawa to increase the accelerated capital cost allowances for Canadian industry to "align with the more generous depreciation recently introduced in the U.S."

In the 2017 federal budget, the Trudeau government altered tax treatment that allowed petroleum producers to deduct all expenses from discovery oil and gas wells in one year — something that's available in the United States — moving Canada's oilpatch instead<span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> to a 30-per-cent annual deduction rate.</span>

"We are competing for capital with the U.S., as well as other jurisdictions,<span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Segoe UI, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, Helvetica Neue, sans-serif;">"</span><span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> said Tim McMillan, head of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.</span>

"This has been something that has helped drive investment into the U.S., at the expense of Canada."

More news on this file could come Wednesday when Morneau unveils his new fall economic update.

All of these issues — rail, tax treatment and resource upgrading — will help, but ultimately they don't get to the heart of the matter: Canada needed more pipelines years ago and Ottawa didn't deliver.

Immediate solutions are now needed to mitigate Alberta's oil supply glut as the oilpatch is "on the verge of losing the winter drilling season," warned <span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Peter Tertzakian, executive director of the ARC Energy Research Institute.</span>

"The reality is we have a really urgent situation," <span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">he</span> said.

"This is a Category Five hurricane hitting us right now and we are talking about cleaning up six months from now."

Federal officials say they are monitoring the situation. Alberta is scouring for other ideas.

But this problem needed to be addressed several years ago.

Now, the energy sector, Albertans and all Canadians are about to pay the price for the country's ongoing pipeline paralysis.

						<description><![CDATA[There's no magic bullet to cure the province's economic woes, according to Calgary-based economist Trevor Tombe, who says it will take long-term plans to fix Alberta's "structural problems" and reduce a growing deficit.

In <a href="https://www.policyschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/AB-Fiscal-Future-Tombe.pdf">a report released by the University of Calgary's School of Public Policy</a>, Tombe shows how the province's debt will continue to rise well past the NDP's goal of balancing the books by 2030.

According to the projections, the province could see a deficit of almost $40 billion by 2040 unless there is "sustained action" from the government to tackle big problems.

But the first step to fixing a long-term problem is to recognize one exists — something politicians in any political camp have yet to do, Tombe said.

"Of course, politicians are going to like quick fixes," Tombe said. "They’re going to like things that can be phrased in a very simple and sound bite kind of way. These challenges, though, are much bigger than that."

The report ran long-term projections for Alberta's spending and revenues from things such as resource royalties, federal transfer payments, property taxes, and health and education spending, among others.

He said fiscal issues — which include increased health-care costs for Alberta's aging population (increasing to $6.5 billion annually by 2040) and the province's reliance on declining oil revenues (which haven't been this low since the 1940s) — will continue to increase provincial debt unless action is taken "sooner than later."

"This is not a post-apocalyptic future by any stretch of the imagination, but that level of debt will require a significant level of the budget being allocated to interest costs . . . and it really does constrain the ability of a future government to respond to shocks in a more deliberate way," he said.

<a href="https://postmediacalgaryherald2.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/gdp.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1171728" src="https://postmediacalgaryherald2.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/gdp.png" alt="" width="689" height="488" /></a>

The report showed Alberta continues to enjoy the lowest net debt to GDP ratio in Canada, at 8.7 per cent.

But Tombe said the province still needs to increase its GDP by roughly 2.7 per cent to end the deficit, suggesting there are a number of combined strategies to reach that goal.

Those options include cutting $1 of every $6 spent by the province or introducing sales taxes to equal 10 per cent — both solutions that could be "phased in gradually" to tackle "longer-term fiscal pressures," increasing revenues while reducing the province's reliance on oil royalties.

"They're very real pressures — they're not going to go away — but we can be a little more deliberate if we act sooner rather than later," he said.

Speaking on Tuesday, Premier Rachel Notley scoffed at the report’s debt-reduction suggestions, saying increasing taxes would be "devastating for economic growth,” while cutting spending could cause “massive damage to our economy.”

But Tombe said increasing sales taxes to Saskatchewan's 11 per cent would simply erase the deficit, as would dialing back spending to levels seen in B.C., Ontario and Quebec.

If revenues and spending continue on their current trajectory, Tombe said the province's net debt levels will be "approaching 50 per cent" by 2040.

Independent credit rating agency DBRS released its Canadian Provincial Government Outlook report on Tuesday.

The agency said the inability to solve Alberta's debt issues are due to "the NDP-led government" and its inability to "demonstrate meaningful action to address its fiscal imbalances."

DBRS maintained its negative rating of Alberta, saying inaction from the NDP continues to "erode" Alberta's "low debt advantage."

While other provinces — such as Ontario, Quebec and Newfoundland — have seen comparable net debts, Tombe said taking action now will avoid the province having to make tough economic decisions "at a time that isn’t your choosing."

"That’s what’s happening to Newfoundland, where they had a very high level of debt, oil prices fall (and) effects their budget in a very similar way to what it does Alberta," he said.

"But they’re really heavily constrained and are forced to take much larger and much more immediate action than Alberta needs to."

Tombe said the province needs to engage with Albertans openly and honestly about future debt issues.

He suggested the province take advice from the auditor general's recent report, which called for "better analysis, monitoring and reporting" within the government, and should also take cues from the federal government's Parliamentary Budget Office to educate Albertans on the province's revenue and spending options.

"It’s certainly a tough public relations challenge, but what we do in this report . . . (is) define the scope of the problem, show that action is required today, and the action that we need in the future gets larger the longer we wait," he said.

													<content:encoded><![CDATA[It looks like any nondescript industrial park warehouse, but the new Deepwater Farms facility in southeast Calgary produces fresh, local food daily using technology that some believe could be the future of agriculture.

This urban farm, located in a 10,000-square-foot building, is the city's first commercial-scale aquaponics facility — meaning it combines hydroponics and aquaculture to raise both leafy greens and fish. Giant tanks house as many as 10,000 fish of varying ages and sizes (currently, Deepwater is raising sea bass), and the waste from the fish is then broken down into nitrates that are used to fertilize the racks upon racks of lettuce, herbs and other greens growing under giant LED lights.

The unconventional technology has given Deepwater the capacity to harvest about 450 kilograms a week of organic, locally grown produce. The company expects to triple that output once it is fully ramped up in late 2019. It can also harvest about 900 kilograms of fish a month — fresh, sustainable seafood that can go straight to the plates of landlocked Calgarians.

"I literally just stumbled across the concept of aquaponics one day on the internet," said company founder Paul Shumlich. "It was the closed-loop aspect that really spoke to me, because we could take a waste product and turn it into a valuable input in another process. It was a symbiotic system between the fish and the plants, and it was organic."

[caption id="attachment_1171872" align="alignnone" width="1000"]<a href="https://postmediacalgaryherald2.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/aqua-2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1171872" src="https://postmediacalgaryherald2.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/aqua-2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="750" /></a> Reid Henuset and Paul Shumlich of Deepwater Farms in Calgary's first commercial aquaponics farm.[/caption]

The 28-year-old Shumlich, who studied entrepreneurship at <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/business/local-business/students-taking-care-of-business">Mount Royal University</a>, has been working on Deepwater Farms for close to five years, testing the technology in various garages and greenhouses, and building his customer base. Convinced there was a market for consistent, reliable produce that doesn't need to be shipped from California or Mexico in the dead of winter, Shumlich started out by cold calling some of the city's top restaurants.

He now has a 30-strong client list, and his produce appears in menu items at establishments including Model Milk, Ten Foot Henry, the Hyatt and the Teatro Group. Japanese restaurant Shokunin is the first restaurant to put Deepwater Farms' fish on the menu, and the company, which now has 10 employees, expects more customers soon.

"In the city, we see the potential to grow 10 times our current size within the next three years," Shumlich said.

While Deepwater is the largest farm of its type in commercial operation in Alberta, there is growing interest in aquaponics in the province. According to its website, Earthis Inc. is working on a design for a commercially viable vertical aquaponics greenhouse and already has a proof of concept up and running in Okotoks. And Current Prairie Fisherman Corp., which began farming tilapia and barramundi in Nobleford in 2008, recently built a large greenhouse to provide their restaurant clients with specialty vegetables as well, using fish waste as plant fertilizer.

Aquaponics is appealing from an environmental perspective and an economic perspective (plants grown through this type of system can grow three times as fast as conventionally grown produce), but it is more complex than other types of farming. Every part of the system must work in harmony and must be constantly monitored to ensure the health of both the plants and the fish. Still, Deepwater's leaders say there is a future for aquaponics even in jurisdictions where indoor growing isn't a necessity.

<a href="https://postmediacalgaryherald2.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/aqua-1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1171871" src="https://postmediacalgaryherald2.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/aqua-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="750" /></a>

"Even though California and Florida have the weather to grow this stuff year-round, they still can't control everything. They're going to get rainy days, they're going to get dry weather," said acting president Reid Henuset. "If we can get our systems down to the point where we know how every little detail of it works, there's no reason we couldn't take it worldwide. Because, with this system, you can control everything."

Deepwater has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise money for expansion.

Shumlich said he believes aquaponics technology could have applications in cannabis production, greenhouses of all types and even industrial agriculture through the production of natural fertilizers.

"Vine crops I don't think it makes sense to grow indoors, you're not going to grow Prairie wheat and barley indoors," Shumlich said. "But I think for things that are being transported out of southern California, like leafy greens, it's definitely the future. And I think in general, smart agriculture is the future of all food production."

						<description><![CDATA[Debate in Alberta's legislature should rise to a higher standard than the kind of base discourse found on social media.

Sadly, that doesn't appear to be the case in Alberta.

On Monday, <a href="https://www.assembly.ab.ca/net/index.aspx?p=mla_contact&amp;rnumber=29&amp;leg=29">Education Minister David Eggen</a> insulted all Albertans who have or are likely to vote for the United Conservative Party as people incapable of critical thinking.

When called upon by <a href="https://www.assembly.ab.ca/net/index.aspx?p=mla_contact&amp;rnumber=77&amp;leg=29">UCP House Leader Jason Nixon</a> to apologize, Eggen refused and, instead, Edmonton NDP MLA Brian Mason stood and claimed that Nixon was trying to "twist the truth" in his call for an apology. So, dear readers, I will let you decide.

First, <a href="https://www.assembly.ab.ca/net/index.aspx?p=mla_contact&amp;rnumber=56&amp;leg=29">UCP MLA Mark Smith</a>, a former social studies teacher, rose to ask a question about changes to the school curriculum in Alberta.

"Given concerns that the curriculum does not teach the basic knowledge they’ll need to think critically when they’re ready, how will the minister address concerns that this inattention to basic knowledge will leave students unprepared to think critically?"

Eggen — the man responsible for shaping what our children must learn in Alberta schools — <a href="http://www.assembly.ab.ca/ISYS/LADDAR_files/docs/hansards/han/legislature_29/session_4/20181119_1330_01_han.pdf">responded this way, as shown in the official legislative Hansard record</a>: "Critical thinking is a very important part of being a member of a modern society. I know that the members opposite don’t like critical thinking because once people learn it, then they will be less likely to vote for the UCP."

There were gasps of shock and then some muted applause at the comment, but even government members didn't seem overly pleased.

Nixon, the UCP MLA for Rimbey-Rocky Mountain House-Sundre, called on Eggen to apologize.

"There were 772,000 Albertans who voted for the conservative side of the question in the last election," Nixon said of <a href="https://www.elections.ab.ca/news-reports/reports/statistics/candidate-summary-of-results-general-elections/">the results of the May 5, 2015, provincial vote</a>.

"There are hundreds of thousands of Albertans who identify as conservatives, and I can tell you that they would be greatly insulted to be informed by the education minister that they cannot critically think. Let’s be clear. This is a government who continually calls Albertans names, a premier who referred to some Albertans as <a href="http://smokyriverexpress.com/notley-calls-albertans-chicken-little-wildrose-party/">Chicken Little</a> because of their concerns with the carbon tax and, most famously, a deputy premier who called Albertans <a href="https://www.leg.bc.ca/documents-data/debate-transcripts/40th-parliament/6th-session/20170313am-Hansard-v43n6">sewer rats</a>. In this case, again to say that they are not capable of critically thinking is appalling, and that minister should stand up and apologize and withdraw his ridiculous remarks about the people of Alberta."

At least <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/alberta-health-minister-apologizes-for-sewer-rats-remark-about-opposition">Sarah Hoffman apologized</a> for her March 13, 2017, "sewer rat" slur in the legislature. Eggen did not apologize. Instead, Mason responded with further insults.

"You know, some people in the house seem to be able to twist the truth like a pretzel, and this is a perfect example," said Mason.

"For example, if you take what the minister of education said — and I thought it was a fairly lighthearted political jibe across the aisle — it was not that people who voted conservative were incapable of critical thought but that, in his opinion, the more people were able to reason critically, the less likely they were to vote for the UCP. I don’t disagree with that point of view," said Mason.

Hmmm? Again, this is what Eggen said: "I know that the members opposite don’t like critical thinking because <em>once people learn it</em>, then they will be less likely to vote for the UCP."

Worse yet, it sounds as though Eggen is saying that once he's through with messing with Alberta's curriculum, kids will be indoctrinated into becoming good little NDP voters.

Politicians are accustomed to being derided but they are right to take a stand when members of the government attack hundreds of thousands of the citizens they are tasked with representing.

Deborah Jabbour, the deputy speaker, said "<span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">I did hear the comment, but in my viewpoint it was again part of that lighthearted banter back and forth. It’s something, arguably, it perhaps would be nice to have a little more of in this assembly and in this chamber. "</span>

<span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">The deputy speaker thinks there should be more of this kind of banter in the legislature. Her Majesty would not be amused.</span>

Many hideous comments have been made in the legislature by the government. I have accumulated a long list.

The worst, perhaps, comes from <a href="https://www.assembly.ab.ca/net/index.aspx?p=mla_bio&amp;rnumber=46&amp;leg=29">Bob Turner, the NDP MLA for Edmonton-Whitemud,</a> who was speaking about the Rwandan genocide when <a href="http://www.assembly.ab.ca/ISYS/LADDAR_files/docs/hansards/han/legislature_29/session_4/20180604_1330_01_han.pdf">he said in June</a>: "I can’t think of it here in Alberta, how it would happen, but it would be as if the official Opposition decided to say that socialists were evil and were non-Christian and didn’t deserve to live. Have I heard that comment? I don’t think I have heard that comment before, but I sometimes get that impression, that sort of thing."

At least the Speaker, Robert Wanner, interrupted Turner to say: "the comments about the Opposition were a little over the top," and Turner apologized.

Turner and Eggen are not just people who bought a party membership and then said something dumb. They were elected to represent all of us.

It's unbecoming of any politician in the legislature to be so crass, but when it's the governing party, which has a majority, it's particularly disturbing to see such antipathy directed not just at members opposite but the population at large.

The legislature is not Twitter. All elected members should remember that.

													<content:encoded><![CDATA[Debate in Alberta's legislature should rise to a higher standard than the kind of base discourse found on social media.

Sadly, that doesn't appear to be the case in Alberta.

On Monday, <a href="https://www.assembly.ab.ca/net/index.aspx?p=mla_contact&amp;rnumber=29&amp;leg=29">Education Minister David Eggen</a> insulted all Albertans who have or are likely to vote for the United Conservative Party as people incapable of critical thinking.

When called upon by <a href="https://www.assembly.ab.ca/net/index.aspx?p=mla_contact&amp;rnumber=77&amp;leg=29">UCP House Leader Jason Nixon</a> to apologize, Eggen refused and, instead, Edmonton NDP MLA Brian Mason stood and claimed that Nixon was trying to "twist the truth" in his call for an apology. So, dear readers, I will let you decide.

First, <a href="https://www.assembly.ab.ca/net/index.aspx?p=mla_contact&amp;rnumber=56&amp;leg=29">UCP MLA Mark Smith</a>, a former social studies teacher, rose to ask a question about changes to the school curriculum in Alberta.

"Given concerns that the curriculum does not teach the basic knowledge they’ll need to think critically when they’re ready, how will the minister address concerns that this inattention to basic knowledge will leave students unprepared to think critically?"

Eggen — the man responsible for shaping what our children must learn in Alberta schools — <a href="http://www.assembly.ab.ca/ISYS/LADDAR_files/docs/hansards/han/legislature_29/session_4/20181119_1330_01_han.pdf">responded this way, as shown in the official legislative Hansard record</a>: "Critical thinking is a very important part of being a member of a modern society. I know that the members opposite don’t like critical thinking because once people learn it, then they will be less likely to vote for the UCP."

There were gasps of shock and then some muted applause at the comment, but even government members didn't seem overly pleased.

Nixon, the UCP MLA for Rimbey-Rocky Mountain House-Sundre, called on Eggen to apologize.

"There were 772,000 Albertans who voted for the conservative side of the question in the last election," Nixon said of <a href="https://www.elections.ab.ca/news-reports/reports/statistics/candidate-summary-of-results-general-elections/">the results of the May 5, 2015, provincial vote</a>.

"There are hundreds of thousands of Albertans who identify as conservatives, and I can tell you that they would be greatly insulted to be informed by the education minister that they cannot critically think. Let’s be clear. This is a government who continually calls Albertans names, a premier who referred to some Albertans as <a href="http://smokyriverexpress.com/notley-calls-albertans-chicken-little-wildrose-party/">Chicken Little</a> because of their concerns with the carbon tax and, most famously, a deputy premier who called Albertans <a href="https://www.leg.bc.ca/documents-data/debate-transcripts/40th-parliament/6th-session/20170313am-Hansard-v43n6">sewer rats</a>. In this case, again to say that they are not capable of critically thinking is appalling, and that minister should stand up and apologize and withdraw his ridiculous remarks about the people of Alberta."

At least <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/alberta-health-minister-apologizes-for-sewer-rats-remark-about-opposition">Sarah Hoffman apologized</a> for her March 13, 2017, "sewer rat" slur in the legislature. Eggen did not apologize. Instead, Mason responded with further insults.

"You know, some people in the house seem to be able to twist the truth like a pretzel, and this is a perfect example," said Mason.

"For example, if you take what the minister of education said — and I thought it was a fairly lighthearted political jibe across the aisle — it was not that people who voted conservative were incapable of critical thought but that, in his opinion, the more people were able to reason critically, the less likely they were to vote for the UCP. I don’t disagree with that point of view," said Mason.

						<description><![CDATA[One city councillor is calling for he and his colleagues to freeze their pay for the remainder of the council term and accept potential salary reductions if recommended by an independent citizen committee.

Coun. Jeromy Farkas says council, including Mayor Naheed Nenshi, need "to lead by example." He plans to put forward a motion to freeze councillors' salaries at a budget meeting next week.

<span class="s1">"My hope is that this pay freeze will mark a change in tone and a return to reality for City Hall. As Calgarians suffer through one of the worst economic recessions in recent history, their representatives at City Hall should do everything possible not to add to their burdens," Farkas said in a statement. </span>

<span class="s1">"Calgarians cannot afford a Council that continues to increase spending and wages beyond our means. It’s time for City Council to make tough choices, just as families and small business owners have been forced to."</span>

Annual salary adjustments for Calgary’s elected officials are made automatically based on Alberta average weekly earnings reports by Statistics Canada.
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Council’s upcoming pay change is not yet confirmed, but Farkas said that data currently available suggests council is poised to receive a pay increase, as average weekly earnings in August in Alberta <a href="https://economicdashboard.alberta.ca/AverageWeeklyEarnings">were up 3.2 per cent</a> from the same period last year.</span></p>
For the second year in a row, Calgary’s mayor and councillors <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/councillors-and-mayor-will-earn-slightly-less-in-2018-based-on-alberta-average">saw their paycheques shrink</a> by a slight margin in 2018.

<span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Annual salaries for the mayor and 14 councillors decreased by 0.08 per cent on Jan. 1, meaning councillors earned </span>$90.73 less than last year, while Nenshi's paycheque was $160.60 lighter compared to 2017.

<span class="s1">Councillors' salaries sat at $113,325.63, plus benefits and expenses, while Nenshi earned $200,586.40.</span>

Nenshi and the city’s 14 councillors <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/mayor-should-take-a-6-per-cent-salary-cut-says-citizen-committee-reviewing-council-pay">took a 2.49 per cent pay cut in 2017</a> over the previous year, following several years of automatic increases.

When Nenshi first ran for the mayor’s chair in 2010, the job came with $177,100 in annual pay, plus benefits and expenses, while city councillors were paid $97,551 annually.

A five-member citizen committee examined the salary adjustment formula in 2017 and said it should stay in place, though the volunteers recommended several other changes, including having council vote annually on whether to accept the pay hike or cut, eliminating transition allowances for elected officials and chopping the mayor’s paycheque by six per cent.

The committee examined council pay in other municipalities and found at the time Calgary’s mayor and councillors earned the most of seven cities profiled, though Edmonton council receives a hefty tax break that pushes their net salary higher than Calgary’s.

						<description><![CDATA[A Calgary researcher says the Fort McMurray wildfire in 2016 showed how pets are often overlooked in disaster planning.

Kim Williams with Mount Royal University's Centre for Community Disaster Research interviewed 32 evacuees, first responders, veterinarians, volunteers, politicians, policy-makers and animal welfare workers involved in Canada's costliest natural disaster.

In a paper released Tuesday, she said a common theme emerged.

"Although the risk of wildfire is high in and around Fort McMurray, neither the province nor the (Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo) had a plan for how to manage companion animals during a disaster," said Williams, an associate professor of women's and gender studies.

Some 88,000 people were forced from their homes as the fire -- so fierce and unpredictable it was nicknamed "the Beast" -- spread into the northeastern Alberta city. Almost 2,600 dwellings were destroyed.

Of the estimated 40,000 pets there at the time, between 1,200 and 1,500 had to be left behind when the whole city was evacuated May 3.

Initially, first responders went from home to home providing food and water to animals, but the evacuation lasted longer than expected. A rescue operation began for the critters four days after their humans left, and the first truckload arrived in Edmonton early on May 8.

Williams called the first 72 hours of the evacuation a "communications gong show" as people struggled to find out if their animals were OK and how they could be reunited.

It's not clear how many pets died.

Williams recommends that an animal welfare expert be included in emergency operations centres during disasters so those concerns aren't overlooked.

She said people she interviewed emphasized that many animal welfare workers are women and they should feel safe and respected in often male-dominated disaster zones.

The paper highlights challenges in obtaining and transporting necessary pet-care supplies during the Fort McMurray evacuation. Williams recommends shipping containers be set up filled with non-perishable supplies such as cat litter at various spots in the province so that they could be easily moved where needed.

During the fire, there were also issues with veterinarians being unable to get access to animals' health records. Williams said she would like to see those records kept in an electronic database.

The research found animal caregivers in Fort McMurray were taken aback by how many exotic animals there were. It was hard enough to wrangle all the dogs and cats, but staff were not prepared for all the lizards, birds and snakes that came their way, Williams said.

"There's a problem with animal licensing," she said. "People need to know that they're there."

Williams said failing to make animal care a bigger part of emergency planning ultimately puts human lives at risk.

"Pets are an integral part of people's families, and humans will delay or refuse evacuation if they cannot evacuate with their pets or, at the very least, be assured that first responders and emergency management personnel have a well-organized plan for managing those pets that must be left behind," she wrote.

"Spontaneous volunteers will sneak into disaster areas to rescue forcibly abandoned pets for the same reasons."]]></description>

						<description><![CDATA[Hundreds of Nelson Mandela High School students gathered Tuesday as guest speaker Terry Crews shared inspirational messages, including the assurance that "you're not alone."

The actor, activist and former football player was in Calgary to appear as the keynote speaker at the eighth annual YWHISPER fundraising gala supporting YW Calgary's programs and services, which was expected to draw more than 900 guests.

At his afternoon presentation on gender equality and masculinity, Crews assured students that everyone is facing challenges.

"When . . . you think, 'it's just me,' please, please know that it's everyone," he said.

The star of the television show "Brooklyn Nine-Nine" and the movie "The Expendables" shared his own experience of growing up in Flint, Mich., his father's struggles with alcoholism and being raised in a highly restrictive environment. He also urged students to talk about their issues and to ask their peers how they are really doing.

Crews said such public speaking engagements are part of his accountability for the past.

"To me, this is more important than every movie I could ever do," he said during a news conference at the northeast high school.

The actor, who shared his story in his book "Manhood" in 2014, described his former self as a "card-carrying member of the toxic masculinity creed."

"I totally looked the other way, and I was part of a complicit system," he said.

That all changed, he said, when his wife left him — a day that marked the beginning of "a new future."

"It was like, 'it’s me,' " he said. "I have been doing the wrong thing. I believed the wrong message. And I had to revamp my whole life from Square 1."

Crews also cited the importance of the #MeToo movement in breaking the silence on sexual violence. The initiative prompted him to share his own story of being sexually assaulted.

"By coming forward, let me tell you, it breaks things," he said. "It’s amazing. This is why, right now, there’s a culture change over the last year. Once the story comes out, everybody’s viewpoint is different."

He also stressed the need for apologies to be accompanied by accountability — something that he has taken to heart in his role as an activist.

"I have to tell my story in order to make amends, in order to correct the complicity that I had," he said.

"Men need to say, 'you know what, we messed that up . . . how can we correct it?' You talk to the victim and ask them how it can be corrected."

Crews said he plans to continue doing his part by sharing his story.

"It’s so important to the healing of our society, to the healing of the people who’ve been wronged," he said. "And it’s the way back. Because this is fixable . . . I am proof."

When asked about the message he delivers to young men about reimagining masculinity, Crews said his advice is to "check other men" when they see inappropriate behaviour.

"Tell another guy . . . 'hey, man, we don’t do that here,' " he said. "It’s so simple and so amazingly effective."

YW Calgary CEO Sue Tomney thanked Crews for his message to students.

"It’s so much a story that has to be told — a message to boys, to youth," she said. "There's 1,800 kids next door who left here today with this kind of message, and it is the next generation."

						<description><![CDATA[Total Energy Services will shutter branches in Western Canada for the first time in its history — and CEO Daniel Halyk isn't pulling punches about what's wrong with the state of the country's energy sector today.

Oil and natural gas prices in Canada are suffering steep price discounts because of a lack of pipelines, while the federal government's <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/business/energy/varcoe-on-bill-c-69-and-pipelines-its-time-ottawa-end-the-dithering">new Bill C-69</a> to overhaul major energy project reviews is expected to exacerbate the challenges.

Regulatory and tax changes have contributed to higher labour, to rising fuel utility expenses and to other operating costs.

The oilfield services firm recently made the decision to close five branches this year after assessing anticipated oilpatch activity in Western Canada, along with the outlook for its growing business south of the border and the recent delays to the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion.

In an interview Monday, Halyk said it was a difficult decision to close the rental and transportation service branches, which provide field support for companies drilling and completing oil and gas wells.

But it had to be done.

"I am looking forward and saying we can't build pipelines, governments are putting more stringent and uncertain hurdles in front of private capital that wants to build this infrastructure," said Halyk, whose company employs about 3,200 people.

"The final straw was when we can't get a pipeline, that some have described as a no-brainer, built…. As a Canadian it sickens me. But as a business person, you go where the work is."

[related_links /]

Halyk’s comments come as the Canadian oil and gas sector is experiencing what some in the industry are calling an "existential crisis" about its ability to grow and what they see as a lack of federal support.

The province is looking at short-term options to unclog the transportation bottleneck to move more oil out of Alberta, but there are no easy fixes.

Due to a lack of energy infrastructure being approved and built over the past decade, Canadian oil pipelines are already full. In turn, <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/business/local-business/varcoe-alberta-cant-have-oil-racing-out-of-the-ground-at-10-a-barrel-says-premier">Western Canada crude prices have tanked</a> in recent months.

The price for Western Canadian Select oil hit an all-time low last week and its discount to benchmark U.S. crude for December delivery sat at US$42.95 a barrel on Monday, according to Net Energy.

All this comes as global oil prices have dropped because of higher international output  and growing inventory levels.

"There is too much oil again and it's clear...there will be too much oil in the market, particularly in the first half of next year," said Judith Dwarkin, chief economist with RS Energy Group in Calgary.

In Alberta, the situation is exacerbated by pipeline problems.

The price differential is now so large, several producers — including Canadian Natural Resources and <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/business/energy/varcoe-cenovus-ceo-says-crude-oversupply-causing-fire-sale-prices-creating-massive-destruction-of-value">Cenovus Energy</a> — have called on the Alberta government to temporarily curtail oil output to allow the price discount to ease.

Premier Rachel Notley said Monday the government has a number of options to consider, and no alternatives have been being taken off the table.

"Right now, time is of the essence," Sonja Franklin of Cenovus Energy said Monday in an e-mail.

"We continue to believe the only effective way to address wide differentials in the short term is through temporary industry-wide production cuts."

Other producers and refiners fiercely oppose the concept, saying the industry should not be inviting government interference in the free flow of energy.

They believe the situation will resolve itself as uneconomic oil will be shut in by companies and prices recalibrate. Producers have voluntarily announced about 140,000 barrels a day of combined output reductions.

Imperial Oil CEO Rich Kruger said all companies should live with the consequences of investment choices made over the decades.

[caption id="attachment_716520" align="alignnone" width="1000"]<a href="https://postmediacalgaryherald2.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/rich-kruger-chairman-president-and-chief-executive-officer.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-716520" src="https://postmediacalgaryherald2.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/rich-kruger-chairman-president-and-chief-executive-officer.jpeg" alt="" width="1000" height="750" /></a> Imperial Oil CEO Rich Kruger cautions that government intervention could damage relations with the U.S.[/caption]

"Government intervention with the objective to manipulate market prices would send a very negative signal to investors about doing business in Alberta and in Canada," Kruger, head of the country’s largest refiner, said in an interview.

"Short-term market manipulation will not resolve the underlying structural issues. To me, it's kind of like treating a patient with a major head injury with Aspirin, and hoping it solves the problem.

"It won't."

Government intervention could also damage Canada's energy trading relationship with the United States, he cautioned.

All of this gloomy talk is unfolding at a time when most producers are assembling their capital budgets for next year.

So far, announced spending plans have been mixed, although some companies are delaying the release of their capital programs due to the ongoing uncertainty.

In a report issued Monday, AltaCorp. Capital analyst Nick Lupick said he expects the larger explorers and producers to "err on the side of caution and conservatism" for 2019.

Tamarack Valley Energy CEO Brian Schmidt said the differential could lead to some deep cuts in capital for the industry next year if prices continue at current levels.

"If something doesn't change, this is very serious," said Schmidt, who opposes the idea of government-mandated output cuts.

"I laid off a rig here yesterday; these guys were ready to go to work — crews all lined up and now they're laid off. Why are we talking about curtailment? Why don't we talk about how to move product and get better prices."

Players in the oilfield services sector are bracing for lower spending and activity from petroleum producers next year if the situation doesn't improve.

The drilling sector, which has already seen 20 of its best drilling rigs leave the country in recent years, is watching cash flow levels for producers being squeezed, which will inevitably impact capital budgets if it continues for several more months.

[caption id="attachment_463339" align="alignnone" width="1000"]<a href="https://postmediacalgaryherald2.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/downtown78.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-463339" src="https://postmediacalgaryherald2.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/downtown78.jpeg" alt="" width="1000" height="750" /></a> Kevin Neveu, CEO of Precision Drilling.[/caption]

"There is a high degree of anxiety with my customers," said Kevin Neveu, CEO of Precision Drilling, the country’s largest driller.

While oilpatch drillers are now focused on the traditionally busy winter drilling season, he believes the bigger question is whether spending tails off in the second half of next year. Meanwhile, Precision is seeing its activity in the U.S. up 30 per cent year over year.

"I have been in the business as a professional since 1982. I have never seen a wider divergence in sentiment than I do today between the U.S. and Canada," Neveu added.

Earlier this month, the Petroleum Services Association of Canada (PSAC) forecast drilling in the country next year will dip by about five per cent to 6,600 wells, with overall spending dropping by about $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion.

Mark Scholz, president of the Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors, notes the number of drilling rigs in Western Canada has fallen from about 850 five years ago before the price crash to 590 today.

It's expected<span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> to drop to 500 by the end of next year.</span>

A government-imposed curtailment on oil output would only make the situation worse, he warned.

"We unequivocally do not support that direction," Scholz said. "If we shut down the winter drilling season, there will be collateral damage in the service industry, no question."

As the battle royal over the curtailment question plays out, the Notley government is prodding Ottawa to take action and<span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/business/energy/varcoe-canada-bought-an-oil-pipeline-how-about-adding-some-locomotives">buy locomotives</a> to help ramp up crude-by-rail shipments. </span>

Notley said Monday she is <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/real-and-present-danger-notley-appoints-three-envoys-to-help-address-oil-price-differential/wcm/a2c7567c-4e12-4305-9a1c-b8cf94a5b4af">appointing three envoys</a> to consult with industry in the coming days about short- and mid-term solutions to shrink the oil price gap. She is also creating a unit in the premier’s office to prioritize more upgrading and refining within Alberta.

Investors are also watching the pipeline drama play out, with many sitting on the sidelines or heading for the exits. The S&amp;P/TSX Capped Energy Index has dropped 24 per cent in the past six months alone.

"Ultimately, we need more pipelines," said analyst Jeremy McCrea of Raymond James.

"Until politicians show they are willing to get these things built, investors have just said we've had enough with Canadian energy until there is some political will to get some of this stuff done."

All this comes as global oil prices have dropped because of higher international output  and growing inventory levels.

"There is too much oil again and it's clear...there will be too much oil in the market, particularly in the first half of next year," said Judith Dwarkin, chief economist with RS Energy Group in Calgary.

In Alberta, the situation is exacerbated by pipeline problems.

The price differential is now so large, several producers — including Canadian Natural Resources and <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/business/energy/varcoe-cenovus-ceo-says-crude-oversupply-causing-fire-sale-prices-creating-massive-destruction-of-value">Cenovus Energy</a> — have called on the Alberta government to temporarily curtail oil output to allow the price discount to ease.

Premier Rachel Notley said Monday the government has a number of options to consider, and no alternatives have been being taken off the table.

"Right now, time is of the essence," Sonja Franklin of Cenovus Energy said Monday in an e-mail.

"We continue to believe the only effective way to address wide differentials in the short term is through temporary industry-wide production cuts."

Other producers and refiners fiercely oppose the concept, saying the industry should not be inviting government interference in the free flow of energy.

They believe the situation will resolve itself as uneconomic oil will be shut in by companies and prices recalibrate. Producers have voluntarily announced about 140,000 barrels a day of combined output reductions.

Imperial Oil CEO Rich Kruger said all companies should live with the consequences of investment choices made over the decades.

"Government intervention with the objective to manipulate market prices would send a very negative signal to investors about doing business in Alberta and in Canada," Kruger, head of the country’s largest refiner, said in an interview.

"Short-term market manipulation will not resolve the underlying structural issues. To me, it's kind of like treating a patient with a major head injury with Aspirin, and hoping it solves the problem.

"It won't."

Government intervention could also damage Canada's energy trading relationship with the United States, he cautioned.

All of this gloomy talk is unfolding at a time when most producers are assembling their capital budgets for next year.

So far, announced spending plans have been mixed, although some companies are delaying the release of their capital programs due to the ongoing uncertainty.

In a report issued Monday, AltaCorp. Capital analyst Nick Lupick said he expects the larger explorers and producers to "err on the side of caution and conservatism" for 2019.

Tamarack Valley Energy CEO Brian Schmidt said the differential could lead to some deep cuts in capital for the industry next year if prices continue at current levels.

"If something doesn't change, this is very serious," said Schmidt, who opposes the idea of government-mandated output cuts.

"I laid off a rig here yesterday; these guys were ready to go to work — crews all lined up and now they're laid off. Why are we talking about curtailment? Why don't we talk about how to move product and get better prices."

Players in the oilfield services sector are bracing for lower spending and activity from petroleum producers next year if the situation doesn't improve.

The drilling sector, which has already seen 20 of its best drilling rigs leave the country in recent years, is watching cash flow levels for producers being squeezed, which will inevitably impact capital budgets if it continues for several more months.

[caption id="attachment_463339" align="alignnone" width="1000"]<a href="https://postmediacalgaryherald2.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/downtown78.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-463339" src="https://postmediacalgaryherald2.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/downtown78.jpeg" alt="" width="1000" height="750" /></a> Kevin Neveu, CEO of Precision Drilling.[/caption]

"There is a high degree of anxiety with my customers," said Kevin Neveu, CEO of Precision Drilling, the country’s largest driller.

While oilpatch drillers are now focused on the traditionally busy winter drilling season, he believes the bigger question is whether spending tails off in the second half of next year. Meanwhile, Precision is seeing its activity in the U.S. up 30 per cent year over year.

"I have been in the business as a professional since 1982. I have never seen a wider divergence in sentiment than I do today between the U.S. and Canada," Neveu added.

Earlier this month, the Petroleum Services Association of Canada (PSAC) forecast drilling in the country next year will dip by about five per cent to 6,600 wells, with overall spending dropping by about $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion.

Mark Scholz, president of the Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors, notes the number of drilling rigs in Western Canada has fallen from about 850 five years ago before the price crash to 590 today.

It's expected<span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> to drop to 500 by the end of next year.</span>

A government-imposed curtailment on oil output would only make the situation worse, he warned.

"We unequivocally do not support that direction," Scholz said. "If we shut down the winter drilling season, there will be collateral damage in the service industry, no question."

As the battle royal over the curtailment question plays out, the Notley government is prodding Ottawa to take action and<span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/business/energy/varcoe-canada-bought-an-oil-pipeline-how-about-adding-some-locomotives">buy locomotives</a> to help ramp up crude-by-rail shipments. </span>

Notley said Monday she is <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/real-and-present-danger-notley-appoints-three-envoys-to-help-address-oil-price-differential/wcm/a2c7567c-4e12-4305-9a1c-b8cf94a5b4af">appointing three envoys</a> to consult with industry in the coming days about short- and mid-term solutions to shrink the oil price gap. She is also creating a unit in the premier’s office to prioritize more upgrading and refining within Alberta.

Investors are also watching the pipeline drama play out, with many sitting on the sidelines or heading for the exits. The S&amp;P/TSX Capped Energy Index has dropped 24 per cent in the past six months alone.

"Ultimately, we need more pipelines," said analyst Jeremy McCrea of Raymond James.

"Until politicians show they are willing to get these things built, investors have just said we've had enough with Canadian energy until there is some political will to get some of this stuff done."

						<description><![CDATA[To say that Topp, Notley's former chief of staff, is hostile towards Alberta's main industry would be a gross understatement.]]></description>
													<content:encoded><![CDATA[Talk about a political landmine.

Premier Rachel Notley appointed three special envoys Monday to work with the energy industry to find solutions to close the oil-price differential that is costing Canada more than $80 million a day.

One of those special envoys is <a href="https://edmontonjournal.com/news/politics/graham-thomson-notleys-chief-of-staff-brian-topp-resigns">Brian Topp</a>, Notley's hand-picked former chief of staff and a former federal NDP leadership candidate. To say that Topp is hostile towards Alberta's main industry would be a gross understatement.

In fact, Topp has said that calling Alberta's oil 'ethical' is akin to calling landmines ethical if they were to be built in Canada.

I'm not making this up! It would be a great punchline to a joke except it's not funny.

This is what Topp wrote in a <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/second-reading/a-modest-proposal-for-harper-why-not-ethical-landmines/article619934/">Globe and Mail opinion piece</a> that appeared on Dec. 11, 2011: "In addition to being a global salesman for carbon, Peter Kent (Canada's then environment minister in Stephen Harper's federal government) can take on a new ethical sales job: Let's get into ethical landmines."

Topp wrote that not only has the "government of Canada become a huckster" of Canadian oil "but Mr. Harper and his ministers want us to think this is a principled thing to do — something to celebrate."

Yes folks, meet <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/corbella-tzeporah-berman-better-get-her-facts-straight-before-she-talks-to-ata">Tzeporah Berman</a> 2.0! Does Notley never learn? How many times is she going to invite enemies of Canada's energy industry to "consult" with energy players. Couldn't she have found at least a hydrocarbon agnostic rather than an outright hater?

<a href="https://oilprice.com/oil-price-charts">Currently, West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark price for oil is trading at $57.42. Meanwhile, the price of Western Canadian Select closed at $14.68 on Friday. That's a differential of $42.74 — one of the biggest gaps ever.</a>

Put another way, Alberta's oil is fetching just one-quarter of the price of WTI oil, simply because we can't get our oil to tidewater where it would fetch WTI pricing.

[caption id="attachment_1171036" align="alignnone" width="1000"]<a href="https://postmediacalgaryherald2.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/topp-2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1171036" src="https://postmediacalgaryherald2.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/topp-2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="750" /></a> Brian Topp, left, celebrates Thomas Mulcair's leadership victory in Toronto on March 24, 2012.[/caption]

One of the reasons we can't get our oil to tidewater is because of people like Topp, Berman and <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/corbella-the-enemies-of-albertas-energy-industry-are-running-the-province">their ilk</a>, who have been very successful at stranding Alberta oil to North America by opposing everything to do with Canada's energy industry, particularly pipelines.

“This price gap is a real and present danger to the Canadian economy,” Notley said at a Monday news conference in Edmonton. “Everything that we do short of building new pipelines and getting more value from our resources is not a long-term fix.”

She's right. So why did she appoint Topp as a special envoy to deal with this issue? Topp has already exacted incalculable damage to Alberta's main economic driver. He is credited (or blamed depending on who you speak to) — with <span class="s1">devising the whole 'carbon tax for social license' pipeline strategy that has gotten Albertans nowhere. </span>

He is also Notley's partner in crime for bringing in the carbon tax — that she never campaigned on.

And Topp is also credited with the investment-destabilizing royalty review on energy, the disastrous revamping of the province’s electricity market that has cost taxpayers billions, the hiking of corporate taxes during an economic downturn and other capital-crushing enterprises that have left this province and its citizens struggling.

The other two envoys Notley appointed to report directly to her include University of Calgary School of Public Policy executive fellow Robert Skinner and deputy minister of energy Coleen Volk.

The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) says the differential has cost Canada at least $13 billion in the first 10 months of 2018.

[caption id="attachment_1171035" align="alignnone" width="1000"]<a href="https://postmediacalgaryherald2.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/topp-1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1171035" src="https://postmediacalgaryherald2.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/topp-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="600" /></a> Brian Topp waves to supporters at the NDP convention on March 24, 2012.[/caption]

"This is about trying to engage with industry players," Notley said. "As you know, (industry leaders) can't come together and make decisions because the law doesn't allow for that to happen," she said, referring to laws against collusion.

Topp is also <a href="https://www.straight.com/article-472791/vancouver/ndp-candidate-targets-tarsands-economics">quoted in 2011 as saying</a> that the environmental consequences of Alberta's oilsands are “shocking” and that Canada should “produce a great deal less hydrocarbon energy."

It's ironic, because Topp may end up getting his wish if these envoys can convince industry players to voluntarily slow production of oil until the differential gap narrows. The only difference is, Topp would love nothing more than to permanently slow down Alberta's production of oil.

"This disaster is the result of failure by governments and the success of a foreign-funded campaign of special interests to landlock Canadian energy," said United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney during a media scrum outside of the Blackfoot Diner Monday afternoon.

"Justin Trudeau's veto of the <a href="https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/we-are-very-disappointed-loss-of-northern-gateway-devastating-for-many-first-nations-chiefs-say">Northern Gateway Pipeline</a>, his killing of <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/business/energy/transcanada-cancels-energy-east-pipeline-project">Energy East</a> through massive new regulations, his surrender to President Obama's veto of <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/business/energy/u-s-federal-court-blocks-keystone-xl-pipeline">Keystone XL</a> and his failure to overcome the obstruction around the <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/tag/trans-mountain-pipeline">Trans Mountain</a> Expansion altogether is why we've got to the situation where we are giving our oil away," said Kenney.

"Our American friends are making out like bandits as a result of this giveaway of Alberta's family jewels. It must stop."

Kenney says he is in favour of imposing quotas on energy production to reduce the glut of Alberta oil flooding the market if industry doesn't voluntarily do so.

"This asset does not belong to the oil companies, it belongs to Albertans. We need to do what we can to protect the value of that asset," he said.

Notley has done the right thing by naming special envoys to help facilitate some kind of voluntary reduction between Alberta's energy companies to reduce the glut of, and the differential of, Alberta oil.

Too bad she laid out a political landmine of her own creation in the process.

						<description><![CDATA[Albertans looking to report breaches in securities law now have additional safeguards from the province's investment watchdog.

On Tuesday, the Alberta Securities Commission — which protects Albertans from Ponzi schemes, frauds and insider trading — announced the creation of a program to make reporting the schemes easier for whistleblowers.

Commission CEO Stan Magidson said the new Office of the Whistleblower will allow directors, employees and stakeholders in the investment world to "safely and easily" report "misconduct in our capital market."

“This program enables whistleblowers to provide critical information about securities misconduct with increased confidentiality protections and without fear of repercussion,” said Magidson.

He said new provisions in the Alberta Securities Act under Bill 20 will "encourage compliance with securities laws" and make it possible for the commission to "intervene, investigate and minimize harm to investors.”

The commission says the new office will streamline the reporting of potential frauds, market manipulations or any "securities-related matter." Tips can also be made online through the <a href="http://www.albertasecurities.com/industry/Pages/default.aspx">Alberta Securities Commission's website</a>.

The protection of a whistleblower's identity and "protection from reprisal" — such as firings, demotions or harassment — is mandated under the Securities Act.

The commission said those protections are "further strengthened" by its "ability to take enforcement action" against any company or group found targeting a whistleblower for coming forward.

[related_links /]

"Employees are encouraged to provide good-faith tips on securities-related misconduct by their employer, which can be a person or company," the commission said in a news release.

"Tips could include information on insider trading, market manipulation, fraud, or issues relating to corporate disclosure or financial statements."

For additional information on the whistleblower program or to submit a tip, visit <a href="http://www.albertasecurities.com/industry/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">albertasecurities.com </a>or call 1-833-295-4387.

The Alberta Securities Commission is the regulatory agency responsible for administering the province's securities laws and protecting investors.

						<description><![CDATA[Premier Rachel Notley threw back her head and laughed.

She actually did that twice. It was an under-reaction. She was entitled to slap her knee and howl.

The premier was answering questions about Calgary council's bizarre attempt to keep leftover Olympic money already paid by Ottawa and the province, and also get cash promised for the actual Games.

To add to the zaniness, there had been doomed background buzz about a Olympic rescue effort involving  . . . Edmonton.

First up at Monday's meeting, council voted to wind up BidCo.

Then Nenshi said Calgary should get to keep the $10.5 million from Ottawa and $10 million from the province.

That was nervy enough. But immediately after, council voted to approve Nenshi asking both governments for much of the $2.1 billion promised for the actual Games.

After Notley straightened out her face, she said: "We're still looking into the state of play with the money that was initially put forward with respect to the bid and the plebiscite."

Translation: Send back the money, or we'll send bill collectors.

Regarding the attempt to get some of the $700-million provincial offer for Olympic facilities and upgrades, Notley added: "The city of Calgary is certainly always welcome to make representations for various and sundry infrastructure projects."

Further translation: Get back in line with all the other municipalities.

There was no word on these council requests from Ottawa. A question brought only deep silence.

Coun. Diane Colley-Urquhart cast the only vote against Nenshi asking Ottawa for money the voters clearly rejected in last Tuesday's plebiscite.

She called it "foolish  . . . a feeble attempt, in my view, to save face."

It was all that, with a touch of humiliation thrown in.

But council's flailing did show how much regret is on the loose out there. Many people would still like to find a way to rescue the bid.

To that end there have been efforts for several days toward Edmonton stepping in. Influential people in both cities have been making a lot of calls.

Edmonton Mayor Don Iveson acknowledges Tuesday that these approaches were being made, but pretty well spiked the notion that they would go anywhere.

“I'm aware that there have been some Hail Mary conversations with different folks in Edmonton—particularly in the sports and business community, people who have been involved in international games movement in the past,” he said, “but none of them have actually come to city hall with any kind of proposal.”

Iveson mentioned  a point that's bugging many mayors; there's still no infrastructure funding deal with the province.

“Quite frankly, until that’s resolved, I’d have no interest in talking about anything to do with bread and circuses out in the future,” he added.

So it's dead, barring a miracle.

But something like a joint Calgary-Edmonton bid probably should have been the plan all along.

The province would have had far less trouble dealing with a two-city request for funding — which, by the way, would very likely have been lower.

There might never have been a plebiscite. The bid could be surging ahead even now.

That would have been great for the province and both cities, in my view.

But Calgary councillors wanted the whole thing. Then they turned against their own idea, and now have nothing to show for it all except an empty cap in hand.
