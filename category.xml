								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One city councillor is calling for he and his colleagues to freeze their pay for the remainder of the council term and accept potential salary reductions if recommended by an independent citizen committee.</p>
<p>Coun. Jeromy Farkas says council, including Mayor Naheed Nenshi, need &#8220;to lead by example.&#8221; He plans to put forward a motion to freeze councillors&#8217; salaries at a budget meeting next week.</p>
<p><span class="s1">&#8220;My hope is that this pay freeze will mark a change in tone and a return to reality for City Hall. As Calgarians suffer through one of the worst economic recessions in recent history, their representatives at City Hall should do everything possible not to add to their burdens,&#8221; Farkas said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">&#8220;Calgarians cannot afford a Council that continues to increase spending and wages beyond our means. It’s time for City Council to make tough choices, just as families and small business owners have been forced to.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Annual salary adjustments for Calgary’s elected officials are made automatically based on Alberta average weekly earnings reports by Statistics Canada.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Council’s upcoming pay change is not yet confirmed, but Farkas said that data currently available suggests council is poised to receive a pay increase, as average weekly earnings in August in Alberta <a href="https://economicdashboard.alberta.ca/AverageWeeklyEarnings">were up 3.2 per cent</a> from the same period last year.</span></p>
<p>For the second year in a row, Calgary’s mayor and councillors <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/councillors-and-mayor-will-earn-slightly-less-in-2018-based-on-alberta-average">saw their paycheques shrink</a> by a slight margin in 2018.</p>
<p><span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Annual salaries for the mayor and 14 councillors decreased by 0.08 per cent on Jan. 1, meaning councillors earned </span>$90.73 less than last year, while Nenshi&#8217;s paycheque was $160.60 lighter compared to 2017.</p>
<p><span class="s1">Councillors&#8217; salaries sat at $113,325.63, plus benefits and expenses, while Nenshi earned $200,586.40.</span></p>
<p>Nenshi and the city’s 14 councillors <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/mayor-should-take-a-6-per-cent-salary-cut-says-citizen-committee-reviewing-council-pay">took a 2.49 per cent pay cut in 2017</a> over the previous year, following several years of automatic increases.</p>
<p>When Nenshi first ran for the mayor’s chair in 2010, the job came with $177,100 in annual pay, plus benefits and expenses, while city councillors were paid $97,551 annually.</p>
<p>A five-member citizen committee examined the salary adjustment formula in 2017 and said it should stay in place, though the volunteers recommended several other changes, including having council vote annually on whether to accept the pay hike or cut, eliminating transition allowances for elected officials and chopping the mayor’s paycheque by six per cent.</p>
<p>The committee examined council pay in other municipalities and found at the time Calgary’s mayor and councillors earned the most of seven cities profiled, though Edmonton council receives a hefty tax break that pushes their net salary higher than Calgary’s.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Debate in Alberta&#8217;s legislature should rise to a higher standard than the kind of base discourse found on social media.</p>
<p>Sadly, that doesn&#8217;t appear to be the case in Alberta.</p>
<p>On Monday, <a href="https://www.assembly.ab.ca/net/index.aspx?p=mla_contact&amp;rnumber=29&amp;leg=29">Education Minister David Eggen</a> insulted all Albertans who have or are likely to vote for the United Conservative Party as people incapable of critical thinking.</p>
<p>When called upon by <a href="https://www.assembly.ab.ca/net/index.aspx?p=mla_contact&amp;rnumber=77&amp;leg=29">UCP House Leader Jason Nixon</a> to apologize, Eggen refused and, instead, Edmonton NDP MLA Brian Mason stood and claimed that Nixon was trying to &#8220;twist the truth&#8221; in his call for an apology. So, dear readers, I will let you decide.</p>
<p>First, <a href="https://www.assembly.ab.ca/net/index.aspx?p=mla_contact&amp;rnumber=56&amp;leg=29">UCP MLA Mark Smith</a>, a former social studies teacher, rose to ask a question about changes to the school curriculum in Alberta.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given concerns that the curriculum does not teach the basic knowledge they’ll need to think critically when they’re ready, how will the minister address concerns that this inattention to basic knowledge will leave students unprepared to think critically?&#8221;</p>
<p>Eggen — the man responsible for shaping what our children must learn in Alberta schools — <a href="http://www.assembly.ab.ca/ISYS/LADDAR_files/docs/hansards/han/legislature_29/session_4/20181119_1330_01_han.pdf">responded this way, as shown in the official legislative Hansard record</a>: &#8220;Critical thinking is a very important part of being a member of a modern society. I know that the members opposite don’t like critical thinking because once people learn it, then they will be less likely to vote for the UCP.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were gasps of shock and then some muted applause at the comment, but even government members didn&#8217;t seem overly pleased.</p>
<p>Nixon, the UCP MLA for Rimbey-Rocky Mountain House-Sundre, called on Eggen to apologize.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were 772,000 Albertans who voted for the conservative side of the question in the last election,&#8221; Nixon said of <a href="https://www.elections.ab.ca/news-reports/reports/statistics/candidate-summary-of-results-general-elections/">the results of the May 5, 2015, provincial vote</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are hundreds of thousands of Albertans who identify as conservatives, and I can tell you that they would be greatly insulted to be informed by the education minister that they cannot critically think. Let’s be clear. This is a government who continually calls Albertans names, a premier who referred to some Albertans as <a href="http://smokyriverexpress.com/notley-calls-albertans-chicken-little-wildrose-party/">Chicken Little</a> because of their concerns with the carbon tax and, most famously, a deputy premier who called Albertans <a href="https://www.leg.bc.ca/documents-data/debate-transcripts/40th-parliament/6th-session/20170313am-Hansard-v43n6">sewer rats</a>. In this case, again to say that they are not capable of critically thinking is appalling, and that minister should stand up and apologize and withdraw his ridiculous remarks about the people of Alberta.&#8221;</p>
<p>At least <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/alberta-health-minister-apologizes-for-sewer-rats-remark-about-opposition">Sarah Hoffman apologized</a> for her March 13, 2017, &#8220;sewer rat&#8221; slur in the legislature. Eggen did not apologize. Instead, Mason responded with further insults.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, some people in the house seem to be able to twist the truth like a pretzel, and this is a perfect example,&#8221; said Mason.</p>
<p>&#8220;For example, if you take what the minister of education said — and I thought it was a fairly lighthearted political jibe across the aisle — it was not that people who voted conservative were incapable of critical thought but that, in his opinion, the more people were able to reason critically, the less likely they were to vote for the UCP. I don’t disagree with that point of view,&#8221; said Mason.</p>
<p>Hmmm? Again, this is what Eggen said: &#8220;I know that the members opposite don’t like critical thinking because <em>once people learn it</em>, then they will be less likely to vote for the UCP.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed-twitter">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Can you believe this? The NDP&#39;s Minister of Education has the audacity to say Albertans who vote conservative do not think critically. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ableg?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ableg</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/abpoli?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#abpoli</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ucp?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ucp</a> <a href="https://t.co/2sSzACQxm0">pic.twitter.com/2sSzACQxm0</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Jason Nixon MLA (@JasonNixonAB) <a href="https://twitter.com/JasonNixonAB/status/1064695077136621568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Worse yet, it sounds as though Eggen is saying that once he&#8217;s through with messing with Alberta&#8217;s curriculum, kids will be indoctrinated into becoming good little NDP voters.</p>
<p>Politicians are accustomed to being derided but they are right to take a stand when members of the government attack hundreds of thousands of the citizens they are tasked with representing.</p>
<p>Deborah Jabbour, the deputy speaker, said &#8220;<span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">I did hear the comment, but in my viewpoint it was again part of that lighthearted banter back and forth. It’s something, arguably, it perhaps would be nice to have a little more of in this assembly and in this chamber. &#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">The deputy speaker thinks there should be more of this kind of banter in the legislature. Her Majesty would not be amused.</span></p>
<p>Many hideous comments have been made in the legislature by the government. I have accumulated a long list.</p>
<p>The worst, perhaps, comes from <a href="https://www.assembly.ab.ca/net/index.aspx?p=mla_bio&amp;rnumber=46&amp;leg=29">Bob Turner, the NDP MLA for Edmonton-Whitemud,</a> who was speaking about the Rwandan genocide when <a href="http://www.assembly.ab.ca/ISYS/LADDAR_files/docs/hansards/han/legislature_29/session_4/20180604_1330_01_han.pdf">he said in June</a>: &#8220;I can’t think of it here in Alberta, how it would happen, but it would be as if the official Opposition decided to say that socialists were evil and were non-Christian and didn’t deserve to live. Have I heard that comment? I don’t think I have heard that comment before, but I sometimes get that impression, that sort of thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>At least the Speaker, Robert Wanner, interrupted Turner to say: &#8220;the comments about the Opposition were a little over the top,&#8221; and Turner apologized.</p>
<p>Turner and Eggen are not just people who bought a party membership and then said something dumb. They were elected to represent all of us.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unbecoming of any politician in the legislature to be so crass, but when it&#8217;s the governing party, which has a majority, it&#8217;s particularly disturbing to see such antipathy directed not just at members opposite but the population at large.</p>
<p>The legislature is not Twitter. All elected members should remember that.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hundreds of Nelson Mandela High School students gathered Tuesday as guest speaker Terry Crews shared inspirational messages, including the assurance that &#8220;you&#8217;re not alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>The actor, activist and former football player was in Calgary to appear as the keynote speaker at the eighth annual YWHISPER fundraising gala supporting YW Calgary&#8217;s programs and services, which was expected to draw more than 900 guests.</p>
<p>At his afternoon presentation on gender equality and masculinity, Crews assured students that everyone is facing challenges.</p>
<p>&#8220;When . . . you think, &#8216;it&#8217;s just me,&#8217; please, please know that it&#8217;s everyone,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The star of the television show &#8220;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&#8221; and the movie &#8220;The Expendables&#8221; shared his own experience of growing up in Flint, Mich., his father&#8217;s struggles with alcoholism and being raised in a highly restrictive environment. He also urged students to talk about their issues and to ask their peers how they are really doing.</p>
<p>Crews said such public speaking engagements are part of his accountability for the past.</p>
<p>&#8220;To me, this is more important than every movie I could ever do,&#8221; he said during a news conference at the northeast high school.</p>
<p>The actor, who shared his story in his book &#8220;Manhood&#8221; in 2014, described his former self as a &#8220;card-carrying member of the toxic masculinity creed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I totally looked the other way, and I was part of a complicit system,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>That all changed, he said, when his wife left him — a day that marked the beginning of &#8220;a new future.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was like, &#8216;it’s me,&#8217; &#8221; he said. &#8220;I have been doing the wrong thing. I believed the wrong message. And I had to revamp my whole life from Square 1.&#8221;</p>
<p>Crews also cited the importance of the #MeToo movement in breaking the silence on sexual violence. The initiative prompted him to share his own story of being sexually assaulted.</p>
<p>&#8220;By coming forward, let me tell you, it breaks things,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It’s amazing. This is why, right now, there’s a culture change over the last year. Once the story comes out, everybody’s viewpoint is different.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also stressed the need for apologies to be accompanied by accountability — something that he has taken to heart in his role as an activist.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have to tell my story in order to make amends, in order to correct the complicity that I had,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Men need to say, &#8216;you know what, we messed that up . . . how can we correct it?&#8217; You talk to the victim and ask them how it can be corrected.&#8221;</p>
<p>Crews said he plans to continue doing his part by sharing his story.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s so important to the healing of our society, to the healing of the people who’ve been wronged,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And it’s the way back. Because this is fixable . . . I am proof.&#8221;</p>
<p>When asked about the message he delivers to young men about reimagining masculinity, Crews said his advice is to &#8220;check other men&#8221; when they see inappropriate behaviour.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell another guy . . . &#8216;hey, man, we don’t do that here,&#8217; &#8221; he said. &#8220;It’s so simple and so amazingly effective.&#8221;</p>
<p>YW Calgary CEO Sue Tomney thanked Crews for his message to students.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s so much a story that has to be told — a message to boys, to youth,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There&#8217;s 1,800 kids next door who left here today with this kind of message, and it is the next generation.&#8221;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite new rules aimed at closing financial loopholes for third-party advertisers, Alberta saw a significant surge in political action committees over the past year, according to the annual report from Alberta&#8217;s chief electoral officer.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.elections.ab.ca/wp-content/uploads/201718-Annual-Report-of-the-Chief-Electoral-Officer-of-Alberta.pdf">report</a>, released Monday, noted of the 21 third-party advertisers registered in Alberta as of March 31, some 13 came into being between 2017 and 2018. Since then, seven of those groups were deregistered, though another 10 sprouted up in their place.</p>
<p>Late last year, Alberta&#8217;s NDP <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/whats-next-for-political-action-committees-as-govt-eyes-new-rules">tweaked election funding regulations</a> to limit the amount of cash third-party groups can spend in the months before an election, capping the amount at $150,000 after Dec. 1 going into an election year.</p>
<p>Albertans are expected to go to the polls in the spring.</p>
<p>David Taras, chair of media studies at Mount Royal University, said the landscape for political financing has significantly changed in recent years, though Canada has seen only a fraction of the massive influence exerted by political action committees south of the border.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tools have changed. You can&#8217;t ignore the fact that social media can reach massive audiences almost instantly,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;With very little money, these groups can have tremendous power in terms of agenda setting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last month, the NDP called for Alberta&#8217;s election commissioner to <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/braid-kenneys-cause-scores-a-cash-bonanza-from-car-dealers">investigate ties between the UCP and Shaping Alberta&#8217;s Future</a>, a PAC that was registered in June, but in only one quarter of reporting managed to raise some $375,000 in support of Jason Kenney&#8217;s party.</p>
<p>Most of those funds were donated from Alberta car dealers, and controversy erupted after a letter surfaced from the Motor Dealers’ Association urging members to donate to the PAC, while suggesting Kenney had promised its board to cancel changes to labour legislation passed by the NDP and meet with industry officials lobbying to roll back recent changes to industry oversight, among other pledges.</p>
<p>Kenney&#8217;s office denied any promises were made, while MDA president Denis Ducharme suggested there might have been some miscommunication over how the letter was worded, echoing the UCP leader&#8217;s insistence that no promises had been made.</p>
<p>While the rise of third-party advertisers has initially aligned with right-leaning parties, several PACs from the opposite end of the political spectrum have also emerged, including a number driven by public-sector unions.</p>
<p>Kevin Lee, director of election finances for Elections Alberta, said despite new rules reigning in the spending activities of third-party advertisers, the agency <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/chief-electoral-officer-warns-of-dangers-of-third-party-activities-in-next-alberta-election">remains troubled</a> by the sizable loopholes that remain for well-heeled donors who are free to fork over money without limit outside of election cycles.</p>
<p>&#8220;The concern still exists not only in the numbers, but more in regard to the dollars that are being raised,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We still have recommendations outstanding in regard to these groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>A review of financial statements released by PACs registered to raise money in Alberta found just more than $2 million was raised as of the third quarter of 2018 for political advertising from both sides of the political spectrum.</p>
<p>Lee noted those groups can continue to raise funds without limit during the election period from corporations or unions, even though their spending is curtailed until election day.</p>
<p>Elections Alberta also saw a significant rise in complaints to the chief electoral officer, prompting the hiring of a full-time investigator last year.</p>
<p>Lee said complaints, of which 51 were filed during the 2017-18 fiscal year, ranged from byelection beefs to party nomination squabbles and concerns levied over third-party advertisers. Of those, 11 resulted in an investigation while eight more remain under review — the remaining 32 were closed with no infractions found.</p>
<p>Despite the rise of PACs in Alberta mirroring the surge in the U.S., Taras noted Canadians are much different in terms of their political allegiance than their neighbours to the south.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Canada it&#8217;s very different — most Canadians are movable. Canadian voters tend to be up for grabs. In the U.S. it&#8217;s blood tribes,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Canadian voters are volatile but they don&#8217;t really pay attention until the last 10 days before an election. Before that, everything is just background noise.&#8221;</p>

				<description><![CDATA[The Liberals are managing down Alberta's industry by imposing new regulations, killing pipeline options, withdrawing tax incentives, and passing energy-hostile bills]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s long been a view in Alberta that the Trudeau government is intentionally winding down Alberta&#8217;s oilsands, and ultimately the entire fossil fuel industry.</p>
<p>This belief has a basis in fact. Indeed, you could say it&#8217;s not a fake fact, but an honest-to-goodness fact fact.</p>
<p>It was Prime Minister Justin Trudeau himself who said <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/we-need-to-phase-them-out-trudeau-draws-fire-over-oilsands-remark">in January 2017</a>: &#8220;We can&#8217;t shut down the oilsands tomorrow. We need to phase them out. We need to manage the transition off of our dependence on fossil fuels.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is going to take time. And, in the meantime, we have to manage that transition.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said that to a friendly audience in Peterborough, Ont. A few days later he was in Calgary, where criticism had erupted.</p>
<p><a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/justin-trudeau-says-he-misspoke-with-talk-of-phasing-out-oilsands">Asked about his comments</a>, he said, &#8220;um, I misspoke . . . I said something the way I shouldn&#8217;t have said it.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Trudeau didn&#8217;t say he&#8217;d been wrong. He just wished, it seemed, that he hadn&#8217;t made himself so obvious.</p>
<p>The key word in Trudeau&#8217;s Peterborough remarks was &#8220;manage.&#8221; As in, &#8220;we have to manage that transition.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what the Liberals have been doing since being elected in 2015.</p>
<p><span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">They&#8217;re managing down Alberta&#8217;s industry by imposing new regulations, killing pipeline options, withdrawing tax incentives and passing energy-hostile bills such as C-48 and C-69.</span></p>
<p>Their goal isn&#8217;t to shutter Alberta&#8217;s main industry tomorrow. They see it as a multi-decade thing.</p>
<p>But managing an industry down is kind of like nudging a toboggan at the top of a steep hill.</p>
<p>Give it a little push and it might slide a short way. Or it might suddenly speed up, run loose and smash into a tree.</p>
<p>That is suddenly happening. A variety of factors encouraged by the Liberals have now run out of control, turning Alberta&#8217;s managed slide into an abrupt and uncontrolled plunge.</p>
<p>The Liberals may get the moribund industry they envision — about a generation early.</p>
<p>The crash in prices for Alberta oil and bitumen is a direct result of Liberal hostility to both the Northern Gateway and the Energy East pipelines.</p>
<p>Those ideologically motivated moves left just one option for offshore export. Eventually, the Liberals had to put themselves in the strange position of buying the Trans Mountain pipeline project for $4.5 billion.</p>
<p>They promptly made such a mess of it that Federal Court judges overturned the National Energy Board approval.</p>
<p>Boxed in, increasingly reliant on overstressed rail, beset by unending hostility in B.C. and berated by U.S. competitors, the typical barrel of Alberta oil now sells <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/business/local-business/varcoe-alberta-cant-have-oil-racing-out-of-the-ground-at-10-a-barrel-says-premier">for a fraction of world prices</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re at the stage where some producers (not refiners) are willing to <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/business/energy/varcoe-growing-list-of-producers-call-on-notley-to-curb-oil-output-to-fix-dizzying-price-discounts">shut in their own barrels</a> in order to drive prices back up.</p>
<p>And that, of course, is exactly what the anti-oilsands people want; a product so valueless that it&#8217;s simply left in the ground.</p>
<p>Investors might see this crisis as a cyclical thing, maybe even a good moment to invest before energy starts roaring again.</p>
<p>But hardly anybody expects a quick relaunch.</p>
<p><span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">How could they, when virtually every industry and investment expert says Bill C-69 will make construction of future pipelines virtually impossible?</span></p>
<p>How could they, when Trans Mountain is mired in the latest round of NEB hearings and will inevitably face more court challenges after construction restarts?</p>

<p>How could they, when <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/braid-a-federal-tanker-ban-that-doesnt-ban-tankers-just-alberta-oil">Bill C-48</a> isn&#8217;t a North Coast tanker ban at all, but an export ban on Alberta&#8217;s refined products? (Under C-48 the world&#8217;s biggest tanker is free to land at Kitimat, B.C., as long as it doesn&#8217;t load a long list of Alberta&#8217;s primary and refined products.)</p>
<p>The whole plan — Liberal as well as Alberta NDP — has been to replace oil and gas with a variety of green and upgraded products.</p>
<p>After a leisurely generation or so, petroleum was to pass into gracious retirement.</p>
<p>But that assumed external economics would somehow stay neutral.</p>
<p>Instead, deeply negative trends are running away with Alberta&#8217;s economy and main industry.</p>
<p>The price gap is forecast to cost the Alberta treasury $5 billion per year.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, respected academic <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/economist-says-no-quick-fix-for-albertas-economy-longer-term-solutions-needed-to-end-debt">Trevor Tombe</a> said the Alberta government&#8217;s annual deficit could be $40 billion by 2040 (equivalent, broadly speaking, to $14 billion today).</p>
<p>Premier Rachel Notley&#8217;s NDP is madly racing to goose upgrading with cash injections.</p>
<p>She <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/real-and-present-danger-notley-appoints-three-envoys-to-help-address-oil-price-differential/wcm/a2c7567c-4e12-4305-9a1c-b8cf94a5b4af">strikes a panel</a> to consult on the price gap and names as one member <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/corbella-notley-names-anti-oil-friend-to-new-energy-panel">Brian Topp</a>, her ex-chief of staff with a long record of hostility to oil and gas. What on earth is she thinking?</p>
<p>The damage to Ottawa&#8217;s finances will be huge, but that seems slow to sink in.</p>
<p>Maybe that&#8217;s because for many of Trudeau&#8217;s MPs and ministers, the crisis looks like a kind of victory.</p>
<p>The plan for Alberta is working. Just a little early, that&#8217;s all.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Albertans looking to report breaches in securities law now have additional safeguards from the province&#8217;s investment watchdog.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Alberta Securities Commission — which protects Albertans from Ponzi schemes, frauds and insider trading — announced the creation of a program to make reporting the schemes easier for whistleblowers.</p>
<p>Commission CEO Stan Magidson said the new Office of the Whistleblower will allow directors, employees and stakeholders in the investment world to &#8220;safely and easily&#8221; report &#8220;misconduct in our capital market.&#8221;</p>
<p>“This program enables whistleblowers to provide critical information about securities misconduct with increased confidentiality protections and without fear of repercussion,” said Magidson.</p>
<p>He said new provisions in the Alberta Securities Act under Bill 20 will &#8220;encourage compliance with securities laws&#8221; and make it possible for the commission to &#8220;intervene, investigate and minimize harm to investors.”</p>
<p>The commission says the new office will streamline the reporting of potential frauds, market manipulations or any &#8220;securities-related matter.&#8221; Tips can also be made online through the <a href="http://www.albertasecurities.com/industry/Pages/default.aspx">Alberta Securities Commission&#8217;s website</a>.</p>
<p>The protection of a whistleblower&#8217;s identity and &#8220;protection from reprisal&#8221; — such as firings, demotions or harassment — is mandated under the Securities Act.</p>
<p>The commission said those protections are &#8220;further strengthened&#8221; by its &#8220;ability to take enforcement action&#8221; against any company or group found targeting a whistleblower for coming forward.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s no magic bullet to cure the province&#8217;s economic woes, according to Calgary-based economist Trevor Tombe, who says it will take long-term plans to fix Alberta&#8217;s &#8220;structural problems&#8221; and reduce a growing deficit.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.policyschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/AB-Fiscal-Future-Tombe.pdf">a report released by the University of Calgary&#8217;s School of Public Policy</a>, Tombe shows how the province&#8217;s debt will continue to rise well past the NDP&#8217;s goal of balancing the books by 2030.</p>
<p>According to the projections, the province could see a deficit of almost $40 billion by 2040 unless there is &#8220;sustained action&#8221; from the government to tackle big problems.</p>
<p>But the first step to fixing a long-term problem is to recognize one exists — something politicians in any political camp have yet to do, Tombe said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, politicians are going to like quick fixes,&#8221; Tombe said. &#8220;They’re going to like things that can be phrased in a very simple and sound bite kind of way. These challenges, though, are much bigger than that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report ran long-term projections for Alberta&#8217;s spending and revenues from things such as resource royalties, federal transfer payments, property taxes, and health and education spending, among others.</p>
<p>He said fiscal issues — which include increased health-care costs for Alberta&#8217;s aging population (increasing to $6.5 billion annually by 2040) and the province&#8217;s reliance on declining oil revenues (which haven&#8217;t been this low since the 1940s) — will continue to increase provincial debt unless action is taken &#8220;sooner than later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not a post-apocalyptic future by any stretch of the imagination, but that level of debt will require a significant level of the budget being allocated to interest costs . . . and it really does constrain the ability of a future government to respond to shocks in a more deliberate way,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The report showed Alberta continues to enjoy the lowest net debt to GDP ratio in Canada, at 8.7 per cent.</p>
<p>But Tombe said the province still needs to increase its GDP by roughly 2.7 per cent to end the deficit, suggesting there are a number of combined strategies to reach that goal.</p>
<p>Those options include cutting $1 of every $6 spent by the province or introducing sales taxes to equal 10 per cent — both solutions that could be &#8220;phased in gradually&#8221; to tackle &#8220;longer-term fiscal pressures,&#8221; increasing revenues while reducing the province&#8217;s reliance on oil royalties.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re very real pressures — they&#8217;re not going to go away — but we can be a little more deliberate if we act sooner rather than later,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Speaking on Tuesday, Premier Rachel Notley scoffed at the report’s debt-reduction suggestions, saying increasing taxes would be &#8220;devastating for economic growth,” while cutting spending could cause “massive damage to our economy.”</p>
<p>But Tombe said increasing sales taxes to Saskatchewan&#8217;s 11 per cent would simply erase the deficit, as would dialing back spending to levels seen in B.C., Ontario and Quebec.</p>
<p>If revenues and spending continue on their current trajectory, Tombe said the province&#8217;s net debt levels will be &#8220;approaching 50 per cent&#8221; by 2040.</p>
<p>Independent credit rating agency DBRS released its Canadian Provincial Government Outlook report on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The agency said the inability to solve Alberta&#8217;s debt issues are due to &#8220;the NDP-led government&#8221; and its inability to &#8220;demonstrate meaningful action to address its fiscal imbalances.&#8221;</p>
<p>DBRS maintained its negative rating of Alberta, saying inaction from the NDP continues to &#8220;erode&#8221; Alberta&#8217;s &#8220;low debt advantage.&#8221;</p>

Alberta Finance Minister Joe Ceci speaks during a press conference about Budget 2018 in the Alberta legislature in Edmonton on March 22, 2018.</p></div>
<p>While other provinces — such as Ontario, Quebec and Newfoundland — have seen comparable net debts, Tombe said taking action now will avoid the province having to make tough economic decisions &#8220;at a time that isn’t your choosing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That’s what’s happening to Newfoundland, where they had a very high level of debt, oil prices fall (and) effects their budget in a very similar way to what it does Alberta,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But they’re really heavily constrained and are forced to take much larger and much more immediate action than Alberta needs to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tombe said the province needs to engage with Albertans openly and honestly about future debt issues.</p>
<p>He suggested the province take advice from the auditor general&#8217;s recent report, which called for &#8220;better analysis, monitoring and reporting&#8221; within the government, and should also take cues from the federal government&#8217;s Parliamentary Budget Office to educate Albertans on the province&#8217;s revenue and spending options.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s certainly a tough public relations challenge, but what we do in this report . . . (is) define the scope of the problem, show that action is required today, and the action that we need in the future gets larger the longer we wait,&#8221; he said.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[To say that Topp, Notley's former chief of staff, is hostile towards Alberta's main industry would be a gross understatement.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Talk about a political landmine.</p>
<p>Premier Rachel Notley appointed three special envoys Monday to work with the energy industry to find solutions to close the oil-price differential that is costing Canada more than $80 million a day.</p>
<p>One of those special envoys is <a href="https://edmontonjournal.com/news/politics/graham-thomson-notleys-chief-of-staff-brian-topp-resigns">Brian Topp</a>, Notley&#8217;s hand-picked former chief of staff and a former federal NDP leadership candidate. To say that Topp is hostile towards Alberta&#8217;s main industry would be a gross understatement.</p>
<p>In fact, Topp has said that calling Alberta&#8217;s oil &#8216;ethical&#8217; is akin to calling landmines ethical if they were to be built in Canada.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not making this up! It would be a great punchline to a joke except it&#8217;s not funny.</p>
<p>This is what Topp wrote in a <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/second-reading/a-modest-proposal-for-harper-why-not-ethical-landmines/article619934/">Globe and Mail opinion piece</a> that appeared on Dec. 11, 2011: &#8220;In addition to being a global salesman for carbon, Peter Kent (Canada&#8217;s then environment minister in Stephen Harper&#8217;s federal government) can take on a new ethical sales job: Let&#8217;s get into ethical landmines.&#8221;</p>
<p>Topp wrote that not only has the &#8220;government of Canada become a huckster&#8221; of Canadian oil &#8220;but Mr. Harper and his ministers want us to think this is a principled thing to do — something to celebrate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes folks, meet <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/corbella-tzeporah-berman-better-get-her-facts-straight-before-she-talks-to-ata">Tzeporah Berman</a> 2.0! Does Notley never learn? How many times is she going to invite enemies of Canada&#8217;s energy industry to &#8220;consult&#8221; with energy players. Couldn&#8217;t she have found at least a hydrocarbon agnostic rather than an outright hater?</p>
<p><a href="https://oilprice.com/oil-price-charts">Currently, West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark price for oil is trading at $57.42. Meanwhile, the price of Western Canadian Select closed at $14.68 on Friday. That&#8217;s a differential of $42.74 — one of the biggest gaps ever.</a></p>
<p>Put another way, Alberta&#8217;s oil is fetching just one-quarter of the price of WTI oil, simply because we can&#8217;t get our oil to tidewater where it would fetch WTI pricing.</p>

<p>One of the reasons we can&#8217;t get our oil to tidewater is because of people like Topp, Berman and <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/corbella-the-enemies-of-albertas-energy-industry-are-running-the-province">their ilk</a>, who have been very successful at stranding Alberta oil to North America by opposing everything to do with Canada&#8217;s energy industry, particularly pipelines.</p>
<p>“This price gap is a real and present danger to the Canadian economy,” Notley said at a Monday news conference in Edmonton. “Everything that we do short of building new pipelines and getting more value from our resources is not a long-term fix.”</p>
<p>She&#8217;s right. So why did she appoint Topp as a special envoy to deal with this issue? Topp has already exacted incalculable damage to Alberta&#8217;s main economic driver. He is credited (or blamed depending on who you speak to) — with <span class="s1">devising the whole &#8216;carbon tax for social license&#8217; pipeline strategy that has gotten Albertans nowhere. </span></p>
<p>He is also Notley&#8217;s partner in crime for bringing in the carbon tax — that she never campaigned on.</p>
<p>And Topp is also credited with the investment-destabilizing royalty review on energy, the disastrous revamping of the province’s electricity market that has cost taxpayers billions, the hiking of corporate taxes during an economic downturn and other capital-crushing enterprises that have left this province and its citizens struggling.</p>
<p>The other two envoys Notley appointed to report directly to her include University of Calgary School of Public Policy executive fellow Robert Skinner and deputy minister of energy Coleen Volk.</p>
<p>The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) says the differential has cost Canada at least $13 billion in the first 10 months of 2018.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is about trying to engage with industry players,&#8221; Notley said. &#8220;As you know, (industry leaders) can&#8217;t come together and make decisions because the law doesn&#8217;t allow for that to happen,&#8221; she said, referring to laws against collusion.</p>
<p>Topp is also <a href="https://www.straight.com/article-472791/vancouver/ndp-candidate-targets-tarsands-economics">quoted in 2011 as saying</a> that the environmental consequences of Alberta&#8217;s oilsands are “shocking” and that Canada should “produce a great deal less hydrocarbon energy.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s ironic, because Topp may end up getting his wish if these envoys can convince industry players to voluntarily slow production of oil until the differential gap narrows. The only difference is, Topp would love nothing more than to permanently slow down Alberta&#8217;s production of oil.</p>
<p>&#8220;This disaster is the result of failure by governments and the success of a foreign-funded campaign of special interests to landlock Canadian energy,&#8221; said United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney during a media scrum outside of the Blackfoot Diner Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Justin Trudeau&#8217;s veto of the <a href="https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/we-are-very-disappointed-loss-of-northern-gateway-devastating-for-many-first-nations-chiefs-say">Northern Gateway Pipeline</a>, his killing of <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/business/energy/transcanada-cancels-energy-east-pipeline-project">Energy East</a> through massive new regulations, his surrender to President Obama&#8217;s veto of <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/business/energy/u-s-federal-court-blocks-keystone-xl-pipeline">Keystone XL</a> and his failure to overcome the obstruction around the <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/tag/trans-mountain-pipeline">Trans Mountain</a> Expansion altogether is why we&#8217;ve got to the situation where we are giving our oil away,&#8221; said Kenney.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our American friends are making out like bandits as a result of this giveaway of Alberta&#8217;s family jewels. It must stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kenney says he is in favour of imposing quotas on energy production to reduce the glut of Alberta oil flooding the market if industry doesn&#8217;t voluntarily do so.</p>
<p>&#8220;This asset does not belong to the oil companies, it belongs to Albertans. We need to do what we can to protect the value of that asset,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Notley has done the right thing by naming special envoys to help facilitate some kind of voluntary reduction between Alberta&#8217;s energy companies to reduce the glut of, and the differential of, Alberta oil.</p>
<p>Too bad she laid out a political landmine of her own creation in the process.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>City council narrowly voted Monday to reject a pilot project aimed at assisting the increasing number of low-income Calgarians who are behind on their water bills.</p>
<p><span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">The move means that a temporary suspension on the practice of cutting off service to delinquent customers has ended, save for those who qualify as low income.</span></p>
<p>Council voted 8-7 against the $2.8-million proposal that would have seen Calgarians who are more than 90 days behind on their bills invited to participate in a pilot program. The program would have provided qualifying customers with low-flow fixtures and assistance to decrease their water use in exchange for rebates on their bill.</p>
<p>Councillors Ward Sutherland, Evan Woolley, Shane Keating, Peter Demong, Sean Chu, Joe Magliocca, Jeff Davison and Diane Colley-Urquhart voted against the pilot. Mayor Naheed Nenshi and councillors Jyoti Gondek, George Chahal, Jeromy Farkas, Druh Farrell, Ray Jones and Gian Carlo-Carra voted in favour.</p>
<p>The number of water accounts in arrears that are written off each year by the city is increasing, municipal officials said Monday.</p>
<p>Administration suggested the city stood to gain in two important ways from the pilot: the assurance of at least a modicum of revenue from delinquent customers and lower water consumption among successful participants.</p>
<p>But Monday&#8217;s debate saw councillors divided on the merits of the pilot.</p>
<p>Coun. Sean Chu suggested the pilot smacked of &#8220;social engineering,&#8221; arguing that he favoured a simple education campaign instead.</p>
<p>&#8220;You’ve got to help yourself first before anybody else can help you. I think that’s the best way to go forward,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Some councillors objected to proceeding with a pilot without more data on customer billing and behaviour being collected first.</p>
<p>Coun. Ward Sutherland wondered aloud whether people on the &#8220;edge of paying their bill&#8221; might decide not to pay in order to be eligible for the benefits of the program.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we should be figuring out what&#8217;s going on first, then have a solution,&#8221; Sutherland said.</p>
<p>But some council members, including Nenshi and Gondek, argued Monday that the pilot was a fiscally prudent approach since the city is already losing around $3 million every year in unpaid bills and it would allow a portion of those losses to be recouped.</p>
<p>Nenshi said a pilot would allow the city to &#8220;test&#8221; potential interventions before committing to a permanent program. He went on to say council shouldn&#8217;t ignore the social cost of families being threatened with water disconnection.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can’t pay your water bill, this is a devastating family event for you,&#8221; Nenshi said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not going to go, ‘oh there’s a program here, so I’m not going to pay my bill’ — that’s not how that works,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you find yourself in an embarrassing situation, in a situation you’re ashamed of where you cannot continue to pay your water bill, this is actually a very big deal.&#8221;</p>

				<description><![CDATA["First unanimous vote on the Olympics," city manager Jeff Fielding quipped. "Congratulations."]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Calgary&#8217;s pursuit of the 2026 Winters Olympics is officially over.</p>
<p>City council unanimously agreed Monday to end the controversial Games bid following its <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/calgarians-vote-no-on-hosting-2026-olympic-games">resounding rejection by Calgarians</a> in a plebiscite last week.</p>
<p>&#8220;First unanimous vote on the Olympics,&#8221; city manager Jeff Fielding quipped. &#8220;Congratulations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mayor Naheed Nenshi said he will advocate for the city to retain the provincial and federal contributions to the $30-million fund created to pursue the $5.1-billion bid.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was money for the city of Calgary for sports work and sports planning and we should keep it. I will continue to advocate for that,&#8221; Nenshi said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not anticipate the bid corporation or the city writing a cheque back to the province and the federal government for a refund.&#8221;</p>
<p>Council&#8217;s vote comes exactly two months shy of the deadline that a bid would&#8217;ve had to have been submitted to the International Olympic committee.</p>
<p>Stockholm and a joint Italian bid from Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo are still in the running to host the 2026 Games.</p>

<p>Some of Calgary&#8217;s bid-related work is expected to continue for at least a few more weeks.</p>
<p>The board of the bid corporation, Calgary 2026, will remain in place until mid-January while work on the bid is winding down, Fielding said Monday.</p>
<p>Administration will return to council by the end of December with a report &#8220;outlining the value&#8221; the city derived from all the work that was completed on the bid over the course of more than two years, including work from the Calgary Bid Exploration Committee (CBEC) and the city&#8217;s Olympic secretariat.</p>
<p>A report on how much money was spent by the city and the bid corporation is expected early in 2019.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Councillors also voted Monday to request that the mayor lobby the provincial and federal governments to &#8220;continue their Olympic and Paralympic funding commitments&#8221; to the city — an amount that exceeds $2 billion.</p>
<p>Coun. Peter Demong said just because Calgarians rejected the bid, it doesn&#8217;t mean they don&#8217;t want to see the city continue to be a centre for &#8220;winter sport excellence&#8221; where competitions and events are regularly held and athletes train year-round. But it will take funding to keep Calgary&#8217;s facilities up to snuff, Demong pointed out.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that the majority of the facilities technically fall under the province’s bailiwick also is a suggestion that this funding should continue,&#8221; Demong said.</p>
<p>Council voted 14-1 in favour of Demong&#8217;s proposal. Only Coun. Diane Colley-Urquhart was opposed.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Colley-Urquhart called the idea &#8220;foolish&#8221; following Monday&#8217;s vote.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a feeble attempt, in my view, to save face,&#8221; Colley-Urquhart said. &#8220;Now that we’ve defeated it and we’re not proceeding with the Olympics, we still want your money?</p>
<p>&#8220;To think we can go and now ask the federal government to still keep their commitment of $1.5 billion, (to) still ask the province for the $700 million — I have no words. It was an interesting, interesting concept.&#8221;</p>
<p>Premier Rachel Notley appeared to reject the notion of Calgary keeping the $700 million at a press conference Monday. She said the city will have to go through the same process as any other municipality to obtain provincial support.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s a bit premature for us to be able to say yay or nay to the specific projects that they have identified. We’ll have to go through our typical process there to consider the individual ones identified,&#8221; Notley said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ll take a look at the asks, when and if they formally arrive at our doorstep.&#8221;</p>

<p>While Nenshi told council it was time to &#8220;accept the will of the people&#8221; and cancel the bid, he also said the decision amounted to &#8220;saying &#8216;no&#8217; to a lot of funding.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mayor told reporters Monday that the city will now have to find somewhere between $600 and $700 million to build a fieldhouse and tackle all of the necessary upgrades to Calgary&#8217;s sport facilities. He said the city will make the case that some of the money should still come from the province, but the rest of the cash will have to come from municipal budgets.</p>
<p>And there won&#8217;t be as much money available for capital projects going forward, said Nenshi.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re in an environment where we are more capital constrained than we ever have been since I’ve been in this job,&#8221; Nenshi said. &#8220;Meaning that council and myself and citizens are going to have to temper our expectations.&#8221;</p>
